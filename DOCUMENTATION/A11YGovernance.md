# Accessibility Governance

## **1. Accessibility-Centered Product Ownership**

### Core Responsibilities

1. **Set Clear Accessibility Goals**:
   - Define accessibility as a **non-negotiable requirement**.
   - Align goals with **WCAG 2.1**, local laws (e.g., ADA, European Accessibility Act), and user needs.

2. **Prioritize Inclusivity in the Product Roadmap**:
   - Ensure accessibility features are planned from the start.
   - Treat accessibility-related tasks as core deliverables, not optional enhancements.

3. **Focus on User Outcomes**:
   - Understand that accessibility improves usability for everyone, not just users with disabilities.
   - Advocate for designs that work across diverse scenarios, including low bandwidth, aging users, and temporary impairments.

## **2. Building Accessibility Awareness**

### Educate and Empower Stakeholders

- **Stakeholder Training**:
  - Conduct workshops to explain the impact of accessibility on user satisfaction and compliance risks.
  - Highlight successful accessibility case studies from competitors or industry leaders.

- **Leverage Data**:
  - Use statistics (e.g., 15% of the global population lives with a disability) to show the business case for inclusivity.
  - Present potential ROI from reaching underserved markets.

## **3. Accessibility in the Product Lifecycle**

### **A. Requirements Gathering**

1. Collaborate with designers, developers, and testers to ensure accessibility is baked into requirements:
   - Define **specific user stories** for accessibility, such as:
     - "As a visually impaired user, I want screen reader support on all interactive elements."
     - "As a user with mobility challenges, I want all actions to be keyboard-navigable."

2. Include Accessibility Acceptance Criteria:
   - Examples:
     - Contrast ratios meet WCAG 2.1 AA (minimum 4.5:1).
     - All forms have error messages linked to fields (`aria-describedby`).
     - Modals trap keyboard focus and restore it after closing.

### **B. Backlog Prioritization**

1. **Embed Accessibility in Epics and Features**:
   - Create dedicated epics for accessibility or integrate them into existing features.
   - For instance:
     - Login Epic: Ensure keyboard navigation for the login form.
     - Media Epic: Provide captions for video content and transcripts for audio.

2. **Use the Accessibility Hexagon** to frame user stories:
   - **Semantic HTML**: Ensure correct tags.
   - **CSS**: Prioritize responsive and scalable designs.
   - **Logic**: Manage focus and dynamic updates.
   - **Unit Testing**: Validate accessibility behaviors.
   - **Automation**: Leverage tools for quick feedback.
   - **Manual Testing**: Plan usability sessions with real users.

## **4. Communicating the Business Value**

1. **Legal Compliance**:
   - Explain the financial and reputational risks of non-compliance, such as lawsuits and fines under ADA, Section 508, or the European Accessibility Act.

2. **Market Opportunity**:
   - Show how accessibility unlocks new markets:
     - 15% of the global population lives with some form of disability.
     - Accessible apps often rank higher in app store reviews.

3. **Brand Reputation**:
   - Position accessibility as a competitive advantage:
     - A commitment to inclusion builds trust and loyalty among users.
     - Companies like Apple and Microsoft lead in accessibility and are celebrated for their efforts.

## **5. Accessibility Workflow for BA, PO, and Stakeholders**

### **A. Discovery Phase**

1. **User Research**:
   - Include people with disabilities in interviews, surveys, and usability tests.
   - Identify pain points and opportunities specific to accessibility.

2. **Competitive Analysis**:
   - Assess the accessibility strengths and weaknesses of competitors.
   - Identify gaps your product can address.

3. **Accessibility Standards Review**:
   - Familiarize yourself with regulations relevant to your market (e.g., WCAG 2.1, ADA, EN 301 549).

### **B. Design Phase**

1. **Wireframes and Prototypes**:
   - Validate designs early with accessibility tools like Contrast Checker or Sketch Plugins.
   - Ensure designs support screen readers, keyboard navigation, and touch alternatives.

2. **Stakeholder Feedback**:
   - Use accessible prototypes to gather feedback.
   - Simulate real-world scenarios, such as navigating with a keyboard or using a screen reader.

### **C. Development and Testing Phase**

1. **Support Development Teams**:
   - Provide clear user stories with acceptance criteria.
   - Ensure accessibility-related tasks are estimated and planned into sprints.

2. **Track Progress**:
   - Use tools like Jira or Azure DevOps to monitor the completion of accessibility tasks.
   - Highlight accessibility metrics in sprint reviews and retrospectives.

3. **Testing Involvement**:
   - Include accessibility outcomes in the Definition of Done.
   - Participate in user testing sessions to observe and advocate for accessibility improvements.

## **6. Addressing Common Challenges**

### **Challenge: Accessibility Perceived as a "Nice-to-Have"**

**Solution**:

- Present the **business case**: Highlight legal risks and lost market opportunities.
- Frame accessibility as a **quality metric**, akin to performance or security.

### **Challenge: Lack of Awareness Among Teams**

**Solution**:

- Organize accessibility workshops or training sessions.
- Provide resources like checklists, tools, and real-world examples.

### **Challenge: Limited Resources**

**Solution**:

- Leverage free and open-source tools (e.g., axe-core, Pa11y).
- Focus on **quick wins**, such as ensuring color contrast and proper labeling of interactive elements.
