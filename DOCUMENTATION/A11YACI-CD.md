# Integrating Accessibility into CI/CD

Configure automated accessibility tests at every commit using tools like:

- axe-linter: Performs code validations during development.
- GitHub Actions: Automates workflows that include accessibility analysis.
- Generate continuous reports to identify accessibility trends and measure progress.

Make accessibility audits a blocking requirement for deployment
