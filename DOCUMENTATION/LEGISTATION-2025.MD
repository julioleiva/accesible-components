# Legislation Coming into Effect in 2025

## 1. **Implementation of the European Accessibility Act (EAA) in 2025**

- Starting in **June 2025**, the **majority of digital products and services** offered by private companies must comply with accessibility standards outlined in the European Accessibility Act.
- This includes, for example:
  - Ticket vending machines and ATMs.
  - Self-service terminals.
  - Electronic products such as computers, mobile phones, and tablets.
  - Telecommunications services, including messaging applications.
  - E-commerce (all online sales websites must comply with WCAG standards).
- Companies failing to meet these requirements will be subject to **fines** and other penalties.

## 2. **Accessibility Obligations for the Private Sector**

- For the first time, accessibility laws will not only apply to **public sector entities** but also to **specific private sectors**, such as e-commerce, telecommunications, transport, and banking. This marks a significant shift in European regulation.
- Member states must ensure that accessible products and services are uniformly available throughout the European Union.

### Impact of the Legislation

- **Government and Public Sector**: Most of the public sector has already adapted to WCAG 2.1, making websites and mobile apps accessible. This includes features like screen reader compatibility, text alternatives for images, and simple navigation via keyboard.
  
- **Private Companies**: With the European Accessibility Act taking effect in 2025, **private companies** will have to meet the same requirements. This is especially relevant for businesses operating e-commerce platforms, online financial services, telecommunications, and other digital services.

- **Fines and Penalties**: Companies failing to comply with the new accessibility standards may face **fines** and penalties enforced by EU member states. The specifics of these penalties will depend on the national legislation of each country.

## Conclusion

Accessibility legislation in Europe is becoming increasingly stringent, with a clear trend towards extending obligations beyond the public sector to include private companies operating in key areas of the digital economy. The **Directive 2016/2102** and the **European Accessibility Act** are the primary tools ensuring digital inclusion. By 2025, many businesses will need to meet standards similar to those already required of the public sector, necessitating significant technological and design efforts to achieve universal accessibility.
