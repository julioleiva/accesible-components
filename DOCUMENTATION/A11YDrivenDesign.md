# Accessibility Driven Design (UX/UI)**

## Core Principles

1. **Inclusive Design**: Ensure visual and interactive elements are accessible to all users, including those with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive disabilities.
   - **WCAG 2.1**: Adhere to web accessibility guidelines to meet minimum standards.
   - **Accessible User Personas**: Incorporate personas with disabilities into the design process to anticipate diverse needs.

2. **Color Contrast**:
   - Minimum contrast ratio for text is 4.5:1. For large text (â‰¥ 24px or 18.66px bold), a ratio of 3:1 is acceptable.
   - Use tools like **Contrast Checker** to validate color combinations.

3. **Typography and Scalability**:
   - Use readable fonts with a base size of at least 16px.
   - Use relative units (`rem`, `em`) to allow text scaling up to 200% without breaking the design.

4. **Navigation Structure**:
   - Design clear, hierarchical menus.
   - Provide multiple navigation methods: menus, quick buttons, and gestures.

5. **Prototyping and User Testing**:
   - Test prototypes with users who rely on assistive technologies before development.
