# Button Component Accessibility Documentation

## Overview

The AccessibleButton component is a web component that provides an accessible, customizable button element. This document outlines the accessibility requirements and implementation details.

## WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance Requirements

### Perceivable

* **Color and Contrast (1.4.3)**
  * Button colors must maintain a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1
  * Focus states must have sufficient contrast
  * Text must be readable against button backgrounds in all states
  * Visual states (hover, active, disabled) must be distinguishable

* **Visual Presentation (1.4.8)**
  * Text must be resizable without loss of functionality
  * Button shape and borders should be clearly visible
  * States must be visually distinct
  * Hover and focus states must have clear visual indicators

* **Adaptable Content (1.3.1)**
  * Button structure must be preserved when stylesheets are disabled
  * Functionality must not depend solely on color
  * Icons must have text alternatives when used

### Operable

* **Keyboard Navigation (2.1.1)**
  * Must be fully operable with keyboard
  * Must respond to Enter and Space keys
  * Must maintain visible focus indicators
  * Tab order must be logical

* **Target Size (2.5.5)**
  * Minimum touch target size of 44x44 pixels
  * Adequate spacing between clickable elements
  * Proper padding for touch interactions

* **Motion and Animation (2.3.3)**
  * Hover/focus animations must respect prefers-reduced-motion
  * Transitions should be smooth and subtle
  * No flashing content or rapid changes

### Understandable

* **Consistent Behavior (3.2.4)**
  * Button behavior must be predictable
  * States must be consistently represented
  * Labels must be clear and descriptive

* **Input Assistance (3.3.2)**
  * Clear indication of button purpose
  * Disabled states must be clearly communicated
  * Feedback for button actions when appropriate

### Robust

* **Compatibility (4.1.2)**
  * ARIA roles and attributes:
    * Native button role preserved
    * Proper aria-pressed for toggle buttons
    * Appropriate aria-disabled state
    * Clear aria-label when needed

## Component API

### Attributes

| Attribute | Description | ARIA Impact |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| label | Button text content | Primary accessible name |
| disabled | Disables button interaction | Sets aria-disabled |
| type | Button type (submit/button) | Affects form behavior |
| aria-label | Accessible label | Overrides visible text |
| aria-expanded | Expansion state | For expandable content |
| aria-pressed | Toggle state | For toggle buttons |

### States

| State | Visual Indicator | Accessibility Feature |
|-------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Default | Base styling | Native button role |
| Hover | Background change | No ARIA impact |
| Focus | Outline/ring | Visible focus indicator |
| Active | Pressed state | No ARIA impact |
| Disabled | Muted colors | aria-disabled="true" |

## Testing Requirements

### Automated Tests

- [x] axe-core validation for WCAG compliance
* [x] Color contrast verification
* [x] ARIA attributes presence and correctness
* [x] Keyboard event handling
* [x] Focus management verification

### Manual Testing

- [ ] Screen reader user flow testing
* [ ] Keyboard-only navigation testing
* [ ] High contrast mode verification
* [ ] Reduced motion compatibility
* [ ] Touch target size verification

### Test Scenarios

1. **Basic Functionality**
   * Button renders with correct role
   * Label is properly announced
   * Click events fire correctly
   * Default behavior works as expected

2. **Keyboard Interaction**
   * Enter key activates button
   * Space key activates button
   * Focus handling is correct
   * Tab order is logical

3. **Screen Reader Compatibility**
   * Label is announced correctly
   * State changes are communicated
   * Disabled state is properly announced

4. **Visual Adaptability**
   * High contrast mode rendering
   * Dark mode compatibility
   * Font scaling support
   * Reduced motion compliance

## Usage Guidelines

### Best Practices

```html
<!-- Recommended: Basic button -->
<accessible-button
  label="Save Changes"
></accessible-button>

<!-- Recommended: Button with ARIA label -->
<accessible-button 
  label="Ã—"
  aria-label="Close Dialog"
></accessible-button>

<!-- Recommended: Toggle button -->
<accessible-button
  label="Menu"
  aria-expanded="false"
  aria-controls="main-menu"
></accessible-button>
```

### Anti-patterns

```html
<!-- Avoid: Empty button -->
<accessible-button></accessible-button>

<!-- Avoid: Missing accessible label -->
<accessible-button
  label="!"
></accessible-button>

<!-- Avoid: Incorrect ARIA usage -->
<accessible-button
  label="Menu"
  aria-expanded="true"
  aria-pressed="true"
></accessible-button>
```
